  ## The complete user facing URL that points to the PE console. If there is

  console_absolute_url: https://master:443

  ## The base URL for constructing service URLs
  ## This must be empty unless the RubyCAS server is running on a different
  ## protocol, host, or port from the Console (e.g.: a development environment
  ## or heavily modified installation) -- in that case it should be an complete
  ## URL to the Console.
  ## No trailing `/`.
  ## console_base_url:

  ## The relative base URL to RubyCAS server
  ## If RubyCAS is running on a different port or protocol, this will be the
  ## full protocol, host and port.
  ## No trailing `/`.
  cas_url: /cas

  ## This is the default service a user will be directed to.
  service_url: /

  ## This is the URL the RubyCAS client uses to reach the CAS server and validate
  ## the Service Ticket. Since it's a network call from the server side, this
  ## needs to be absolute and fully resolvable on the server.
  ## Unless the RubyCAS Server is running on a different host or port, using
  ## `localhost should suffice.
