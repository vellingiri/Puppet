    ## This cipher suite allows FIPS compliance:
    SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:-LOW:-SSLv2:-EXP

    ## Due to the BEAST attack, non-CBC ciphers should be preferred -- but may break
    ## FIPS compliance at the expense of a greater chance of higher security on most
    ## browsers. For the highest security TLSv1.2 should be used, but most browsers
    ## do not support it (only Safari-5 on iOS, IE11 preview, and Chrome 29beta
    ## support it by default).
    ##
    ## This cipher suite provides a good compromise for most browsers:
    ## SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:+RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+AES+256:+CBC3:-LOW:-SSLv2:-EXP
    ## SSLProtocol ALL -SSLv2
